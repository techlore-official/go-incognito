# Section 5 Finale

And that wraps up section 5, finishing the physical privacy and security series.
Not only did section 5 cover the basics, MAC addresses, networking security,
radios, and device separation, but we’ve covered close to everything you need to
know about protecting yourself digitally throughout section 1 through 5.

There’s just one problem. If you’re not living a private and secure lifestyle, it’ll be
easy for most of the work you’ve done to go to waste. How is this? Well, if you give
your personal information to a friend who posts it on the internet, all that time
you spent making sure your data stays private went to waste. If you open a gym
membership and they’re breached exposing personal information, a lot of the
time you spent may go to waste. If you’re not locking your home, a lot of the
physical security we’ve covered can go to waste. Lifestyle is extremely important,
because it serves as another avenue used to eventually have your information
published digitally--meaning we need to implement a proper lifestyle.

This is what section 6 is about. It teaches who you can trust, how to minimize data
access in public, proper anonymization and pseudonymization (we’re going to
create pseudos), how to shop safely, and how to become an activist who
preaches the benefits of privacy and security.

Thank you for tuning in, and I’ll see you in section 6: Living the Lifestyle.

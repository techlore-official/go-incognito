# The Basics

The basics of physical privacy and security is a broad topic with many little
things you need to do. Instead of putting you through 5, 90-second lessons, I put
all of the information randomly into one lesson, titled The Basics. Enjoy!

Let’s start with encryption, one of the most overlooked vulnerabilities. According
to a self-conducted poll by me, close to 80% of people don’t encrypt drives on
their computers. As we’ve discussed in earlier sections, encrypting a file prevents
unauthorized access to that file. This is the same story for full-disk encryption.
Most operating systems by default are not encrypted, meaning they can be
mounted to a computer where someone can access, modify, and delete any files.

A password to login does not encrypt your drives, so this attack will work on all
password-protected devices. I demonstrated this on my YouTube channel, where
I plugged in a flash drive to a computer and accessed all the files on a password
protected system. To combat this, you need to encrypt your drives. Windows
offers Bitlocker on Windows Pro. MacOS has FileVault. Some Linux distros prompt
you during installation to encrypt your system with LUKS. iOS is always encrypted
with a password, and most Android devices also use encryption by default.
These built-in options are great for convenience. As for Windows, Bitlocker is fine,
but it is proprietary encryption, and they store encryption keys. Meaning they
may be able to access your data. I recommend you go with Veracrypt for full disk
encryption on Windows, especially since Bitlocker isn’t available on Windows
home. Veracrypt is FOSS, versatile, and it lets you create hidden volumes to
prevent this type of thing from happening… After setting up full-disk encryption,
make sure you always fully power off your system when leaving it for periods of
time, because it’s possible for someone to dump the memory and get the
encryption keys. For those of you who don’t know what that is, just remember to
shut off your system entirely.

For physical security, you can lock laptops to a desk using a cable lock. That is
what this mysterious port is for on your laptop. Macs don’t have them but most
other PCs do. You can even get a lock that sounds an alarm if cut, and it’ll work
for desktops and other electronics.

Speaking of desktops, lots of motherboards have intrusion kits, that will alert you
if the case on your computer has been opened.

What about public computers? Avoid entering any personal information if
possible. Assume the last person who used it installed malware, either
consciously or unconsciously. You have no control over these devices, so be
cautious when using them, or avoid them altogether.

Another overlooked vulnerability is printers. Many printers have hard drives that
store documents you print and scan. Meaning anything going through the
printer has the possibility of being accessed later on. Let this be a reminder to
wipe hard drives of all data before selling your computers and other devices, we
covered how to wipe data in section 3.

Up next is screen protectors, and not to protect your screen, but to protect your
privacy. Shoulder surfing is a very common, and successful attack done in public
to steal your passwords and personal information. Luckily, it’s easily thwarted by
using a piece of plastic, called a privacy screen protector, *(show your screen
protector)* making it hard to see a screen unless you’re directly looking at it.
There are commercial options, but there are DIY methods. Don’t forget to put
these on laptops and monitors as well.

Next is restricting access to your BIOS--the firmware directly interacting with your
hardware and operating system. The BIOS can be used for wrongdoing in more
ways than one, so I would recommend establishing a password to access and
modify it. Every computer is different, so refer to your manufacturer on how to do
this. Keep in mind, a simple CMOS reset or motherboard battery re-insertion can
quickly bypass the password. So a password isn’t the world’s safest form of
protection, but it can make a small difference. You should also lock down your
boot priority to prevent people from booting into *(show flash drive)* live
operating systems. On the topic of the BIOS, most of them are proprietary and
rely on firmware from your manufacturer; if you want something a bit more open,
libreboot or coreboot may be what you’re looking for.

*(show watch)* Alright, what about smartwatches and fitness trackers? From a
privacy perspective, they track vitals and other health data that could be used by
companies to target you, or they could give up this data to third-parties. From a
security perspective, you’re relying on that said company to secure your data,
something dangerous considering there have been breaches. If you do track
your health in any way, make sure it is all private and not being shared with
anybody--especially the public. This was a problem in the 2015 Amgen Tour of
California. Participants in the bike race were able to identify who had passed
them and later, while online, directly message them. This is creepy, especially with
social media platforms like Strava who publicize where you exercise. If you have
to use something like a GPS watch to track your activities, keep it local on the
watch and avoid syncing it to any devices or accounts.

The last thing to talk about in this lesson is webcams and mics. This has turned
into a bandwagon, where people tape up their webcams while browsing an HTTP
site within Windows 10, and sending a private message on Facebook; as if the
tape is protecting them. Don’t be THAT person who tapes up their webcam and
thinks they’re anonymous. Regardless, it’s still something you should be aware of,
since it’s possible for hackers, intelligence agencies, and even people you know to
access webcams without your knowledge.

The scary thing is this can happen to anybody. Blake Robbins was a high school
sophomore who was called into the principal's office for “improper behavior at
home” His school district gave students MacBooks, but what they didn’t tell the
students was there was software designed to recover the device in case it was
lost. The issue is this software was monitoring all 2,300 students’ behaviour while
they were in view of the webcam. *(eat mike and ikes)* Robbin’s alleged offense
was pill popping, but it was found in court to be him eating mike and ike's candy
while doing his homework. The webcam on Robbins’s Mac took hundreds of
photos, including some of him sleeping in his bed. The school had pictures of
many other students, a few of whom were “partially undressed’. The moral of the
story: first, don’t trust anyone, that’s a topic for section 6. Second, it’s easy for
malicious software to activate your webcam and microphone without your
knowledge, this is true for mobile devices as well.

Desktops are great because they don’t normally have cams and mics built in, but
laptops and phones do. You have two options for the camera: tape it up, there
are many neat options available, or physically remove the camera from the
device. This will obviously remove the camera entirely, but you can use a
third-party webcam that you plug in. As for mics, there are also two options. You
can plug in a dummy mic. The dummy can be an old pair of earbuds that are
snipped near the jack, tricking your computer into thinking there’s a mic. This is a
software workaround though, so I would recommend option 2: remove the
microphone entirely and stick to using external mics.

And that was the basics! It was pretty hectic but I hope you learned a few things
throughout the lesson. The next lesson will be about Mac Addresses, what they
are, and how they can be used to track you. Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you
then!

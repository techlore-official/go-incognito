# Compartmentalization

This lesson will be pretty simple and straightforward, and if you watched the
expendable operating systems lesson in section 4, you’ll find this lesson will have
many similarities.

The ideas in this lesson aren’t foreign to you, your work or school may give you a
device solely used for work or education--separate from your personal devices.
One reason this is done, is to increase security, since one device being
compromised won’t directly lead to another being compromised. As a general
rule of thumb, never conduct personal tasks on a work device or network, since
these are likely monitored; it’s better to use cellular data to do personal stuff at
work. Separating different aspect of your life, is called Compartmentalization

Before we dive into the lesson, here is a major disclaimer, so listen up! I’m going
to give you unrealistic scenarios, repeat: UNREALISTIC! that involve purchasing a
device for everything task you perform. I know this is far from realistic, but I’m
demonstrating how you can utilize multiple devices to benefit privacy and
security. It is a mindset lesson training you how to think differently about device
management. Here goes!

As discussed before, you can’t anonymize your personal identity, so you can get
a device used for your personal stuff: email, banking, school, and other things
you can’t avoid. You should pick a device and operating system with an emphasis
on security; privacy isn’t as important since you can’t hide your personal
identity...although you should still implement the techniques taught in section 3
and 4, and there are ethical reasons to still value personal privacy. Believe it or
not, there are cheap and convenient devices that fit this criteria relatively well:
the Chromebook and the iPad. Both devices are inherently very secure, so if
you’re looking for a high-security device where privacy isn’t a huge concern, they
aren’t a bad option. If you’re a more advanced user, Qubes is the recommended
way to go, but don’t overlook the simple options sometimes. As one of my
teachers once said, “Don’t shoot a fly with an uzi.”

Let’s pick up a second device, one that’s used for anonymous web browsing that
isn’t tied to you. The focus here is privacy. Utilizing Tor is highly recommend,
making options like Whonix, and Tails extremely good options. Don’t forget that
Tor needs to be used properly to achieve decent anonymity, so make sure to
rewatch lesson 4.5 for a refresher.

You can have a third device used only for work. Personally, I have my desktop
used only for video production. I am unable to access any of my personal
accounts from that computer for max separation.

You can have a fourth device used for online dating, created from the ground up
with maybe a pseudonym, or only with small pieces of your actual information
that you don’t want mixed with your fully-fledged personal device.

You can have a gaming device, a naughty device, anything! The sky's the limit,
and the more boundaries created between the activities you do, the harder it is
to tie them together.

Before clocking out, I will remind you this was a mindset lesson. I don’t expect
everybody to buy eight different devices for different tasks; but I do expect you to
start thinking about how certain aspects of your life are mixed, when it could be
beneficial to separate them through a physical barrier, or a digital one using
maybe something like virtual machines or separate user accounts.

To summarize compartmentalization, Create boundaries! Thank you for
watching, and I’ll see you in the section finale.

Section 1 covered basic terms and information needed to get started: explaining
what is privacy and security, why we should care, FOSS, metadata, and the
convenience line. Section 2 was dedicated to getting you a clean slate through
minimalism and other techniques locally, and online. Section 3 taught how to
keep your clean slate clean...by keeping things up to date, checking permissions,
using strong passwords, implementing 2 factor authentication, hardening your
browser, proxies and VPNs, antiviruses, proper file deletion, proper storage
habits, and safe communication.

Section 4 expanded on section 3, by teaching proper browsing habits, comparing
operating systems, using Tor, cryptocurrencies, and performing auditing. Section
5 was dedicated towards protecting your hardware, we discussed basic physical
security, changing your MAC address, properly securing your routers, radios, and
proper device separation.

Section 6 taught how to live the lifestyle. This meant discussing who you can trust,
minimizing access to your data, anonymization and pseudonymization, shopping
safely, lifestyle changes, downsides to being private and secure, and tips on
becoming an activist.

Holy crap, it has been one hell of a journey, but I really hope you’ve learned a lot
through the entire process, and you have or will begin to implement things from
this course.

Now what did this course not include? In general, it didn’t include in-depth
instructions on how to customize specific things. For example, I didn’t cover all of
the settings you can use inside a VPN. There are plenty of guides on this online,
including on my channel, same goes with software like Veracrypt. If there’s
something you want me to expand on, contact me and let me know. Outside of
that, I genuinely think this course is one of the most extensive guides on the
internet teaching how to live a private and secure life. There are hundreds of
sources, and this has all been peer edited and reviewed by several people over
the course of 4 months. I really really hope that it’s been useful and you use this
information wisely.

Thank you all so much for watching; remember to normalize privacy, we have a
right to it, which is looking more and more grim everyday. If you made it all the
way through this course, I highly recommend sharing it with your friends and
family, since we need to educate the people around us. Thank you so much for
watching, and I’ll see you in the next video for our final goodbyes.

# Section 6 Introduction

Welcome to section 6 of the course; Living the lifestyle. This is arguably the most
interesting and important section. When we think of privacy invasion, we think of
digital device management and how this can impact your privacy. But what we
don’t realize is lots of the information we give out in our physical daily lives can
just as easily end up online--making this an important thing for you to learn
about.

Section 6 will not only teach you about the techniques used to track you
everyday: from companies, governments, and people. But section 6 will also teach
the mindset required to think in a precautionary way. Last but not least, you’ll
learn how to preach the benefits of privacy and security in our society, and
hopefully convince the people you know to care about it as well. We will begin
with the first lesson: Who Can You Trust?

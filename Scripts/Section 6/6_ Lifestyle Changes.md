# Lifestyle Changes

This lesson will cover general things we do in our lives that reveal sensitive
information, that we might not normally think about. I can’t cover every
possibility, but I’m going to give you a lot of scenarios and tips that will teach you
the mindset required to change your lifestyle.

Let’s start with your home.

● Make sure your most sensitive valuables like wallets, passports, and
electronics are in a room that isn’t easily accessible from outside, keeping
the most sensitive items in a safe. Not just any safe, a good one.

● Make sure your data is encrypted, and make sure to \* show external hard
drives \* keep backup drives with your data inside of your safe. Always keep
an off-site backup in case something happens.

● You should also consider investing in a security solution to fend off thieves.
They can be bypassed, but it’s mostly to discourage potential burglars. I’d
also recommend security cameras, especially in rooms with sensitive items;
you can set up your own video storage locally to avoid companies
requiring a monthly subscription.

● I hope this is a given, but get rid of your smart devices. They are doing
nothing but listening to everything you do. Alexa even recorded and sent a
private conversation to a person’s contact; go ahead and read the privacy
policy for your smart device if you need more convincing.

● To finish off home tips...never, and I mean never open the door for anybody
unless it’s an expected visitor or a trusted family member or friend. If it’s a
stranger and it’s urgent, they’ll make sure to contact you beforehand, or
leave a method of contact for a second chance. I can’t stress enough how
important this is. Thieves are known to dress up as an unsuspecting
person to scope out the house and people inside of it. If it looks like a good
target, they’ll come back later to rob the home.
Let’s leave your house.

● We’ve already talked about minimizing the amount of personal information
your car reveals in the previous lesson, so make sure to implement those
tips. To add on to that, never leave electronics or other sensitive items in
your car.

● Make sure not to carry your social security number, social security card, or
anything else particularly sensitive in your wallet.

● If you’re going to a protest or rally, be aware that law enforcement is known
to use a tool called StingRay, an IMSI catcher. This allows law enforcement
to identify people at rallies by capturing their phone traffic. If you’re going
to these events, it’s advised to leave your phone on airplane mode.

● Even if you follow every tip throughout the course, it’s extremely difficult to
make yourself private in public, especially with the rise in facial technology.
If interested, there is a pair of eyeglasses that sell for $240 designed to
throw off facial recognition technology, and masks are currently a decent
prevention method.
Alright, so that covers tips for your home and your travels, but there are a few
more tips for the real world you should know about...

● Shred anything with sensitive information. Anything with your name,
address, or other identifiable information should be shredded, this
includes receipts.

● Don’t forget you can opt out of junk mail on the FTC website.

● And when sending sensitive letters, use bankers’ envelopes, double up on
tape everywhere, and dab some superglue on the envelope to avoid
tampering. Try to disguise the nature of the letter. And if your threat model
is higher, you can use a felt-tipped pen or fountain pen to address letters;
this way if chemicals are used to tamper with the letter, it will make the ink
run. You can also wrap letters in carbon paper to make the carbon run.
Some people even wrap letters in aluminum foil, so if chemicals make the
envelope transparent, the snooper still can’t view the letter.
Okay, that wraps up some real world examples, but what about the digital world?

● First, never post publicly that you’re traveling. There’s nothing better for a
criminal than alerting them that your house is deserted for weeks. Take
pictures of your vacation while you’re there, and post them once you’re
back home.

● Speaking of traveling, never constantly share your location. This increases
the odds of stalking and tracking from people who may or may not have
your best interest. Remember that 7/10 acts of sexual violence are
committed by someone known to the victim. Ensure Find my Friends is
disabled, Snapchat’s location tracking, as well as any other similar form of
these services. While you’re at it, I’d advise disabling traces of personal
data on social media, or deleting it altogether. If you want a balance, never
post pictures of yourself, and if you do, obfuscate the triangle formation
made by your eyes and mouth, since this is how our brains are able to
quickly distinguish faces.

● The last digital tip involves your social security number. Make sure to go to
ssa.gov/myaccount and create an account with your social security
number. There are settings in there that will make it extremely difficult for
anyone but you to do anything with your social. Not many people know
about this, and it’ll significantly lower your chances of identity theft.
And that finishes off different examples of how you should be thinking about the
privacy and security of your daily lives. If you have kids, family, or friends, make
sure to educate them. It’s very important for them to understand why they should
or shouldn’t do certain things when they’re around you, and why they should
implement certain things into their lives as well.

I hope this lesson was a wakeup call, or at least made you rethink some of the
things you do every day. There are many more tips and tricks out there, but the
most important thing you need is the mindset, which is what this lesson gave. I’ll
see you in the next lesson discussing the downsides to privacy and security,
thank you for watching, and see you soon.

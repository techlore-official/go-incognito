# Who Can You Trust?

Who can you trust? That’s a loaded question! Let’s start with a disclaimer: I don’t
want to make it seem like everybody is out to get you, and no one is trustworthy
in your life. But I do want to make you cautious with how other people can
intentionally or unintentionally leak sensitive information about you.

Let’s begin with the people closest to you--family and close friends. These are
your most trusted peeps, but proceed with caution. Not because they’re
necessarily untrustworthy, but their habits can be improper. For example, you
and your wife are outside your home when she decides to take a selfie with you to
share on Facebook. What she doesn’t realize is she included the house number in
the picture, in addition to location metadata within the image. To top it all off, her
Facebook account is public. A thief now has the necessary information to rob
your home. Another more common scenario is someone screenshotting a
conversation between you and them, or a friend gives out your personal phone
number to a stranger without your consent. On the other hand, you should trust
your family and close friends well enough for them to understand why you may
want parts of your life kept secret. The key is communication, tell them
transparently what information they can or can’t share about you with others.

Moving on, casual friends and strangers are a much bigger concern. In the movie
Now You See Me, the 4 magicians ask the character Tressler casual questions,
which he gladly answers. What he doesn’t realize is he is gave them answers to his
bank’s security questions. The 4 magicians eventually break into his bank
account, and steal his funds as part of their magic trick. This is a form of social
engineering, “The manipulation of the natural human tendency to trust.” Social
engineering is dangerous because it exploits the way humans function to achieve
unauthorized access. How is this done? Well we talked about phishing scams
earlier in the course, which relied on you trusting a fraudulent website that steals
your information--this is a form of social engineering. *(show phone)* This can
happen with your phone calls as well. Hackers can call their targets from a
"spoofed" phone number claiming to be someone needing your information. It
could be spoofed to be your AT&T provider asking for your account details, or
the IRS asking you to pay “missing” taxes.

Tailgating is another form of social engineering where a person pretends to be a
delivery service at a corporate office and asks an employee to hold the door
open for them. If you think these things don’t happen, here’s a fun story similar to
tailgating: A 17-year-old male from Oklahoma was fired from his job at Walmart
for stealing money. Instead of considering himself lucky that he got away without
being charged, he put his uniform back on and stole $30,000 from three other
Walmarts by pretending to be a general manager from another store.

Alright, so we’ve covered trusting individuals, both well-known ones and
strangers, as well as how social engineering can be very dangerous. But what
about trusting companies to handle your data? This course has already
discussed dozens of different companies who have misused data—many times
without user knowledge. So, can we trust them?

Toysmart.com made a pledge of privacy to its customers, promising not to share
its database with other companies or third parties. Then, the company went
bankrupt and promptly put its user database for sale. This practice continues to
this day. Hulu stated they will sell data if they suffer bankruptcy. In fact, this
article from the New York Times found in the case of a merging, acquisition,
bankruptcy, or asset sales, many companies, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook,
Google, and LinkedIn may transfer user data to another entity without user
consent. We saw this happen during RadioShack’s bankruptcy, when they
attempted to sell user credit and debit cards, social security numbers, dates of
birth, and even phone numbers; luckily politicians stepped in before ALL of the
data was fully sold, although some still was.

Let these examples be a lesson that even when companies promise privacy, they
could be lying, or they could unpurposely implement poor methods of securing
your data.

The moral of this lesson is be careful with who handles your information. Don’t
give up data when it isn’t needed, and don’t trust everybody to handle your
information as well as you would. Here are some general rules for you to follow:
1) Don’t give up information that isn’t required. RadioShack didn’t need your
social security number, Facebook doesn’t need your home address, and a
stranger in public doesn’t need your date of birth.

2) Be aware. Ask yourself why a company needs a specific type of data. Don’t
be afraid to ask why something is needed, and be aware of the existence of
social engineering attacks and how they can impact you.

3) Don’t succumb to pressure. If you feel that a piece of information doesn’t
need to be collected, ask to go a different route, or deny access to the
information and pick a different service if possible.

4) Make sure the people around you know what information they can or can’t
share about you. You can keep your life as locked down as possible, but if
your partner or best friend is sharing your phone number and email that’s
intended to be secret, well...that’s not good.

And that wraps up this lesson. There will always be those you trust, but remember
to educate and communicate with them about your privacy and security habits.
As for companies and other entities, it’s safe to assume the worst, because there
are little to no regulations on how your data is shared at least in theUS, and most
companies will take the opportunity to abuse your data for a quick profit. Thank
you for watching, and I’ll see you in the next lesson: Minimizing Data Access.

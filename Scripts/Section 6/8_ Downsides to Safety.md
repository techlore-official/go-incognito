# Downsides to Safety

Like most things in life, there is commonly a downside. This course has been
created to improve your privacy and security. The benefits are clear: you get
protection from people, companies, and governments who unjustifiably want
your information; not to mention the benefits from fraud, identity theft, and other
criminal activities. These are amazing pros! But, there are problems that are
difficult to avoid, and this lesson will prepare you for the most common ones.

The first and most obvious issue is your convenience will go down the drain. We
talked about this in the very first section of the course; the more private and
secure you get, the more inconvenient your life becomes. This is why I introduced
all of you to the convenience line, an imaginary line to help you establish your
limits.

Another downside is you may come across as suspicious to employers and other
people if they aren’t able to find information about you online. Social media’s a
valuable tool when you post positive things you do, since it’s a public way for
people to learn more about you, and it doesn’t limit you to a piece of paper and a
10 minute interview. Obviously, this is terrible for your privacy, but be aware that
some employers won’t be thrilled when they can’t conduct research under the
table.

Tying to that last point, you’re not going to (as easily) be able to share your life
with people you know. We always want people to see or react to major things we
accomplish, part of the reason we accomplish things is so that we can share our
accomplishments. If you don’t have social media, sharing your life events and
accomplishments are much more difficult to do.

The last downside is the possibility of obsession and/or phobia. It’s not
uncommon for everything we’ve discussed in the course to shock some people. As
big as the problems we discussed in the course are, be grateful for the positives
they bring into our lives. Being able to navigate anywhere with Google Maps,
instantly messaging people around the world, sharing moments with anybody
instantly--is awesome! There is a hidden dark side to it, but don’t forget to enjoy
the positives.

I hope this has shed some light on the downsides to living a more private and
secure life, but I also hope it doesn’t discourage you from implementing a good
amount of everything we’ve talked about. The benefits you’ll get greatly outweigh
the downsides, and there’s always a middle ground; where do you draw your line?

Make sure to stick around for the next lesson, which is the last informational
lesson of the course, and it’s the most important. It talks about activism,
advocacy, and things you can do to make an impact around you, hopefully
convincing others to join the privacy and security movement. I’ll see you then,
thanks for watching.

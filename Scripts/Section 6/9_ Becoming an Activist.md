# Becoming an Activist

Like I said in the last lesson, this is THE MOST important part of the course:
spreading the message and good information to the people around you. The
more people who take their privacy and security seriously, the more companies
and governments will need to cater to the public opinion.

You know what’s not changing?

Let’s start with companies! \*Play Facebook Cares Snippet\* \*Play recording
through Timeline of privacy issues\* Facebook doesn’t care about your privacy,
because there’s no pressure for them to care. There are no regulations and not
enough people making a negative impact on the company. If they lose 50% of
their customers, and all of them left for privacy concerns, Facebook would start
to take their privacy more seriously. The same idea applies to security concerns.
My old bank, one of the largest banks in the United States, doesn’t offer proper 2
factor authentication. If more people left the service because of security
concerns, they would change their ways. Donate money and use products that
are built to protect you. This is pretty self-explanatory, so let’s move on to making
an impact on the people around you.

The best thing you can do is to tell people why you do what you do. Trust me, they
notice the precautions you take, and if they know you’re not some weirdo, they’re
going to want to hear what you have to say. I constantly get questions about why
I do what I do. Why do I use a password manager, a VPN, \* show screen \* why is my
screen always off from their point of view. The goal here is to give an answer that
makes the other person rethink privacy and security. Tell them you use a privacy
screen protector because shoulder attacks are a common way people get their
passwords stolen, and password managers allow you to make an infinite amount
of secure passwords--something like that. Lastly, make sure to bring out the
positives in services, it’s easy for us to point out the bad things:

- VPNs slow down your speeds

- DuckDuckGo isn’t as good as Google

- Linux isn’t as easy to use as Windows, etc.
Instead of bringing out the negatives, bring out the positives. VPNs encrypt your
traffic on a public wifi network and give you freedom from your ISP, DuckDuckGo
allows you to use a huge number of search engines all from one location, and
Linux runs from a flash drive that can be booted from any computer--not to
mention it being free.

On the topic of people, don’t forget to join communities. There’s the subreddit
privacy, there’s my channel where we’re all about that, and we have a Matrix room
discord server, and Telegram group. Join communities in person as well, the EFF
has meetups you can attend, and take a look at summits and events like Defcon.
Get involved! If nothing out there seems to be exactly what you’re looking for,
create your own community and have fun with it.

The very last thing I want to talk about is normalizing privacy. In our society, we
associate privacy with criminality. We discussed why privacy is important in
lesson 1.2. There are a few things we can do to improve this problem. First,
implement and use the tools we’ve discussed throughout the course. That way
people around you, who know you’re not a bad person, realize it’s not that weird
to value your data. You should also keep them noticeable, leave Tor and other
tools in your toolbar or desktop so people can see you use them. \* show your
swag \* You can take this to the next level by donating to these projects for
merchandise. The Tor project, the EFF, the FSF, and this course all offer
merchandise like shirts and stickers to help you spread the message. This helps
people in public realize these services are nothing to be ashamed of. Normalize
privacy; if there’s two words you should take home from this entire course, it’s
those. 

Normalize privacy!

To summarize, if you begin to take your privacy seriously, then you might find
others will do the same. At first you may only have an impact on your circle of
friends. If more and more begin to care, then politicians and businesses will find
that they have to start paying attention. A small number can lead to big changes.
Thank you for watching, and I’ll see you in the section 6 finale.

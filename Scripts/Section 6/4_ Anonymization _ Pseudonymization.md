# Anonymization & Pseudonymization

We’ve covered pseudonymisation and anonymization earlier in the course, but it’s
important for us to discuss these more in-depth. We’ve previously covered it’s
nearly impossible to make your personal identity anonymous. We are registered
and part of the system. We have social security numbers, we have birth
certification, we pay taxes and have jobs. But this doesn’t mean we can’t hide or
separate the non-necessities from ourselves. How do we do this?

I’ll tell you right after this short message:

To recap, pseudonymization is the creation of an alias, or ghost identity.
Pseudonyms are completely legal as long as you’re not using them to defraud
someone else. They allow you to sideload information to aliases not tied to you,
which is useful when services or people are requesting information that doesn’t
necessarily need to be yours. We’ll cover how to make them at the end of this
lesson.

Anonymization involves making sure something you’re doing is tied to no identity.
The most common way of accomplishing this is by blending a group of people
together, so no one user is unique. This is exactly what Tor does, it is built from
the ground up to make you look like everyone else using it--assuming you use Tor
properly.

To sum up how to use the two concepts...I would recommend you anonymize any
traffic that doesn’t require an account with Tor and other anonymization tools
discussed throughout the course. If something requires an account, but you
don’t want it to be tied to your identity, pseudonyms are the way to go. The idea is
to keep your pseudos and anonymous sessions completely separate from your
true identity. Sounds easy enough, but how do you make a pseudonym?

Let’s make one together with the master of pseudonyms: Roger Smith the Alien.
But before we do that...remember the one and only golden rule:
Your pseudonyms must not be tied to your personal identity.

Okay, first...we need to figure out what this pseudo is for. What information does
he/she need to have, and how in-depth does it need to be. Your pseudo can be a
name and email, or it could be something like this... For this lesson, let’s create a
pseudonym for Roger with the basics.

Let’s start with a name. Since this will function as a general-purpose pseudo that
doesn’t need to be a unique person, let’s give it a degree of anonymity.
We’ll pick a very common name to blend in, something like Brian Smith.

Now, Roger needs a form of communication, and this will vary depending on what
service he’s trying to access. If it’s an online survey, he’ll need an email. If it’s
Facebook, maybe also a phone number. He needs to form a communication
method that isn’t tied to him. We’ve previously covered services in the course like
tempmail, guerillamail, freephonenum, inumbr, burner, and shuffle.

Up next, Roger needs an origin story. Is his pseudo Brian married? Does he have
kids? Where did he grow up, how old is he? If Brian is only a digital pseudo, Roger
can fake all of this easily. If Brian goes out into the real world though, some parts
of Brian’s story may need to match with Roger’s story. He can’t say Brian is 80
years old when Roger looks 25; people may have some trouble believing him.
If Roger wanted to go more in-depth, he could give Brian his own shipping
address using a PO box or Private Mailbox separate from his. If Brian needs to
make a payment, maybe for a VPN, it needs to be done in a way not tied to Roger,
we covered how to do this earlier in the course.

And that’s Brian Smith, one pseudo. I would recommend creating multiple
pseudos for different purposes. Maybe you have one for online surveys, one for
spam, one for Jamba Juice, and one for craigslist--the sky's the limit! If you need
help with creativity, fakenamegenerator is a great resource. And before wrapping
things up...remember the golden rule:

**Your pseudonyms must not be tied to your personal identity.**

And that’s the lesson, it’ll give you a lot of freedom with different ways you can
sideload information that would otherwise be tied to your personal identity. I
want to thank Roger Smith for helping me out, and I will see you in the next lesson:
shopping safely. Thanks for watching.

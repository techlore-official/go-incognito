# Minimalism.

Before we even discuss the internet, let’s talk about minimalism pertaining to your
local files and programs. “Local” means files and programs stored on your \*show
devices \* physical hard drives, phones, and other personal devices. In general,
the rule of thumb is the more programs and services you’re using, the higher
chance of a security exploit and/or personal data collection.

Why is this? Let’s find out after this short message…

A basic example: \* Hold Smartphone \* Almost all of us have smartphones. Let’s
say you download the Facebook app onto your phone. It can now read all of your
contacts, your SMS messages sent outside of the app, and it can view your phone
calls. This already is alarming. But let’s say you download Snapchat. Now
snapchat has access to similar information, but two different companies have
access to it. You have doubled the chances of your information leaking in some
fashion. Over on your computer, it’s not uncommon for programs to also open up
your computer to exploits, like Java, Reader, and Flash. The more apps and
programs you leave installed on your devices, the greater chance of an exploit,
or that a company will harvest your information, making your digital footprint
more extensive. The goal is to be as minimal as you possibly can, I want you to
brag about how few apps you use on your devices.

So where do we start? First, if you just got a new device, it most likely comes with
preinstalled programs called bloatware, which is a loose term for any software
that isn’t needed and is considered bloat. Windows loves this, Android has this,
iPhones have this, almost all devices do. They take up valuable system resources
and more often than not are detrimental to your privacy and security. The first
thing I’d recommend you do when you get a new device is to reinstall the
operating system to remove the bloatware. If the operating system itself includes
bloatware (like windows), uninstall as much of it as you can manually.

After that, we need to delete those old games and other apps you don’t use
anymore--it’s doing much more harm than good in the background! In some of
my old videos, I clearly didn’t follow this. Just looking at the apps I had installed,
you could learn so much about my life, and you can bet that some of these apps
were collecting data in the background.

The top shows my cellular provider, Cydia shows I was jailbroken, Pearson
PowerSchool reveals that I was most likely a minor attending High school or
middle school. OneDrive shows I was using a cloud service that uses no default
encryption; just to name a few! Swiping to page 2, things just get juicier and
juicier, if we, humans, can visually see these patterns, imagine what these devices
can do when they’re collecting countless amounts of data on your personal life.

As a totally random note, I want to remind you that most software that comes
with new accessories is completely unneeded, and you should avoid installing
them. Printers come with their own software, but you don’t need it because your
operating system already takes care of that. Monitors come with software too
which you don’t need. Headphone and other device manufacturers also like
advertising their own software; in general it’s not necessary.

So that explains apps and programs, but what about files. I’m going to talk about
cookies, cache, and history in the next lesson, but right now let’s discuss your
personal files: photos, videos, documents, and anything else you own. Deleting
some of your personal files has advantages as well. First, if someone is able to get
into your devices, they’re going to have a tougher time figuring out information
about you. As an example, I frequently clear my SMS messages so that if someone
gets into my phone, they can’t view any old private messages. On a digital level,
some programs on your computer have the ability to collect your data, like
antiviruses cloud-based programs, and even certain browsers, so the less you
give them the better. The last and most obvious benefit is that you will free up
storage on your devices and have a much more organized life.

First, go through and remove things that are unused and unneeded across all of
your devices, typically this involves cleaning up your desktop, removing files in
your Downloads folder, and emptying your trash bin. Now technically things
emptied from your trash or recycle bin can be recovered, but we’ll cover
shredding files later on in the course. Then you can start moving to your other
files, finding things you really have no use for anymore. Old screenshots,
unneeded videos, expired documents, this is all on you to decide. At this point, I’d
recommend transferring any documents which contain sensitive information
about your life to a properly secured \* show both \* external hard drive or flash
drive, which can only be accessed if you physically plug it in, that way the
information isn’t always accessible by your operating system. We will cover how to
properly secure these later on with encryption.

As for mobile devices, Android does have a file manager which you should
frequently check on to make sure there are no files you can remove. And for iOS
11, there is a “sorta" file manager for you as well. Don’t forget to frequently clear
your text and call history to keep things minimal on all mobile devices.
I do want to mention that deleting icons from your computer’s desktop isn’t
uninstalling programs, it has to be done in the control panel or the new Windows
10 settings app, I can’t tell you how many people aren’t aware of this. For Macs
you have to drag it into the trash bin. For the more advanced users, when you
uninstall programs from your computer (especially in windows), there are
commonly still leftovers of the program which aren’t fully removed. Some key
places to look are these directories. \* C:/Program Files, C:/Program Files (x86),
C:/User/YOURUSERNAME/Appdata \* You can also hit Windows Key + R, and enter
Regedit.exe. Once here, just search for keywords from the program to find
leftover registry keys, or there’s a tool in the next lesson which will automate this
process. For Mac users, do the same thing by looking through these directories
to clear program remnants. To avoid leftovers like these in the future, make sure
to remove settings for your programs during the uninstallation process, if
prompted, and use a free tool like Geek Uninstaller, which automatically picks up
remnants when you uninstall a program. For Macs, AppCleaner is an amazing
app that works similar to Geek uninstaller.

Before wrapping it up, Parents and spouses, try to avoid installing 3rd party spy
software on your loved one’s devices. First, try to create enough trust between
you two to figure out a physical compromise, like leaving the phone outside the
bedroom for kids. 3rd party spy software is extremely dangerous because it gains
access to everything on a phone, and it’s all being stored on that company's
servers. This is a huge security and privacy issue, software like mSpy continually
suffers leaks, and an app even leaked Teens’ Apple IDs, which is enough
information to break into an account--as we’ll discuss later in the course. If you
have to setup parental controls or spy software of some sort, most devices have
built-in parental controls allowing you to do this without handing over data to a
third party company. Additionally, lots of routers allow you to setup parental
controls as well, so you don’t need to setup parental controls on the device itself.
No matter what, avoid spy software from third party companies, that’s a big
no-no.

So that wraps it up for minimalism. Remember: Less is more. The less programs,
apps, and files you store on your devices, the less data there is to collect about
you, and less risk of a security exploit. This was a simple and casual step, but it’s
very important nonetheless down the road. This is also one of the beautiful
things to do, because it actually speeds up your devices and improves your
battery life, without really affecting convenience. The next lesson for section 2 will
dive a little bit deeper into minimalism. I will see you then.

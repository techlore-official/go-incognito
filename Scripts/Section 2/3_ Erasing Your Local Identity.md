# Erasing Your Local Identity

Now that we understand the basics of minimalism, we need to finish cleaning up
our local identities, Let’s discuss \* show cookies & Cash\* cookies, cache, and any
temporary files stored on your devices.

You know what you can’t remove though? These ads...well unless you’re on the
premium version...let’s get it out of the way!

History, cookies, and cache (or we’ll use HCC for short) are most commonly seen
and used within web browsers. History shows all the websites you’ve visited,
cookies are used by websites to track your visits and activity like when you have a
shopping cart on a website, and cache stores elements of a webpage so if you
load the webpage again, those elements are ready to go without needing to be
refreshed.

HCC all have their functions, but they are terrible for your privacy, since websites
are able to view and record data associated with them.

\* Dip cookies in Milk \* Cookies are one problem, and are frequently used for
cross-website tracking, but \* Dip huge cookie \* supercookies are a super
problem. Think of supercookies as those squabbits from Brickleberry, or a hydra.
If one dies, two more are created, although this is just an analogy. You can’t clear
super cookies like you can clear regular cookies, because it is injected into your
system through several different methods. One method is an HTTP header by an
Internet service provider. This uniquely identifies your device and is used to track
you. Verizon was caught doing this in 2016, using a unique code attached to your
device called a UIDH. Even after being fined, they still continue this practice to
this day by default. You have to call them and opt out of this tracking, yay for
Verizon! Because this information is injected between the device and the server
that it’s connecting to, there’s nothing that a user can really do. Another common
form of supercookies are utilized through Adobe flash and Microsoft Silverlight,
which are both outdated and very rarely used, so make sure you have these
uninstalled.

In section 3 and 4, I will teach you how to stop all of these things from being
recorded in the first place. But for right now, we’re focusing on deleting cookies
and other temporary files on your current setup. Let me show you the easy and
lazy way first, followed by the more in-depth method.
The easy way is by clearing them within your web browser itself. Each browser’s
different, but typically in the settings you’ll see an area to clear history and any
other data like cookies and cache. This is quick, easy, and lazy.

But what about all the stuff other programs and your operating system store on
you? For this, we need to use \* Hold Up Screwdriver \* special tools.

CCleaner is a free option for both Windows and MacOS, it’s a good program, but
it is closed source. On top of that they did suffer a hack which installed malware
onto user’s computers by hacking the certification on the latest version.
(Although do keep in mind this was extremely targeted and could have happened
to just about any service.) I still use CCleaner, but there’s also a great alternative.
BleachBit is free and open source and does very similar things; it’s much more
trusted in the community. Both of these tools will clear tons of unneeded data on
your computer, which is exactly what we want! There are tons of great guides
already on how to use them, that you can find online, so I’ll let you discover these
tools, and I may do a guide on it on my channel as well. Sadly there’s no GUI
version of BleachBit for Macs at the time of making this course, so CCleaner is
the recommended service for you Mac users, unless you want to do it manually.

The last little thing you want to do if you’re on Windows is go to file explorer, right
click on your computer’s boot drive, click properties, and then Disk Cleanup. Click
clean up system files, then select everything and delete it.

You should clear your history and data on your mobile devices as well, but I’d
recommend you avoid using third party tools to do it, since phones really don’t
need it. Both iOS and Android have good built-in tools for both browsers and
individual apps to clear cache and other types of temporary data like HCC. On
Android you can use SD Maid, but like I said--it’s really not needed.

So now we’re all done, but before finishing up the lesson, here’s a fun story about
erasing your files--told by the notorious hacker, Kevin Mitnick: In April 2013,
Matanov, a cab drive from Massachusetts went to dinner with a pair of brothers,
where they discussed the events that happened that day at the Boston Marathon
bombing--where someone planted rice cookers packed with nails and gunpowder
to explode at the finish line. The brothers at the table, Tamerlan and Tsarnaev
would later be identified as prime suspects. Although Matanov said he had no
prior knowledge of the bombing, he allegedly left a post-bombing meeting with
law enforcement officers to delete the browser history from his computer, which
resulted in charges against him. This also happened with the college student
David Kernell, who hacked Sarah Palin’s email account. The charges against both
Matanov and Kernell resulted from something called the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, which aimed at preserving data to be used as evidence.

So, if you followed this lesson, you could be charged if you were to be accused of
a crime. Luckily, you’re hopefully not being accused of a crime, and the
workaround is to not store the information in the first place, and this is exactly
what I will be teaching you how to do in section 3. This was just a lesson to start
you off on a cleaner slate. Thank you for watching, and I’ll see you in the next
lesson: erasing your online identity.

# Erasing Your Online Identity

Now that we’ve cleared up our local identities, it’s time to move over to the
internet. So far, everything leading up to this point has been pretty
straightforward and simple to do. This is going to be the first lesson where many
of you are going to find your limits. Erasing your online identity is a very tough
thing for us to do, many of your accounts you’ve most likely owned for a good
part of your life, and some of them you may use everyday. So yes, this is the true
beginning of a clean slate. \* Hold phone to ear \* Let’s start with a wake-up call.

[Promotional Spot]

The first thing I want you to do is login to your main email, and search ‘sign up’ in
the search bar to get an unofficial a list of emails services you’ve signed up for.
You should also search ‘verify’ as well. It might shock you to see how many
services have your personal information, if one of these services experiences a
breach, most of your other accounts will also be exposed assuming you supply
similar (or even the same) information. The sheer amount of services we
mindlessly sign up for is pretty insane.

Next, if you have a Google account, go to Google’s ‘My Activity’ page, and browse
through all of the information collected by Google. This can be very unsettling,
for me it was the recordings of every time I said OK Google that freaked me out.

Next, let’s go to our good friend Google.com. I want you to type in your email
address, that’s it. It’s not uncommon to find random websites where people post
your email with the password to get into your account right there from the search
engine. This comes from hacks or leaks, and this is how a lot of people are able to
get into unprotected accounts. You can also search your full name, phone
number, and other personal details to see if your info is out there.

After that, go to ‘have I been pwned’ and type in your email address to see if any
of your information has been leaked from data breaches. More than likely you’re
going to find some stuff you don’t want to see. If there’s nothing, then congrats,
you haven’t suffered a leak with that email.

Lastly, go to pipl.com and type your name here to see if your personal profile is
available for anybody to view. A lot of you will have a profile here. There’s also
anywho.com, which has a reverse phone lookup I recommend you try out. These
are just a few of the dozens of people-searching websites out there.

After doing all of that, my hope is that you at least see the potential risks in
blatantly signing up for services with your personal information. Now you might
be asking how your information gets on these websites. Well, a lot of it comes
from online services you sign up for who sell your data. Post offices and other
agencies could also be responsible, and we’ll cover that in section 6. The goal is
to configure your browsing habits so this is unlikely to ever happen again, which
we will cover later in the course. But for now, let’s work on removing what’s already
online.

Remember that search you did within your email? For every service you signed up
for that you no longer need, go to that service’s website, login, and find a place to
delete your account. Before you delete the account, I’d recommend faking any
personal information since we don’t know if services are actually deleting your
data from their servers, and this could one day be breached and released
publicly. Now yes, faking personal information is totally legal as long as you’re
not using it for fraud or illegal activities. You can fake information by changing
the email to a randomly generated one on tempmail.org, changing your phone
number to one on freephonenum.com, changing your password to something
random that you’ll never remember again, and removing any other personally
identifiable information about you. Some services are stubborn and won’t allow
you to delete an account. First, try searching on Google the service’s name
followed by ‘delete account.” A lot of times you’ll find instructions there. If there is,
in fact, no way to delete an account, which does happen, just falsify your
information, email, and password and never touch the account again. Deseat.me
offers a convenient service that scans your emails for any accounts you opened,
which is really nice! But keep in mind you are handing over all of your information
to another company, so I would not recommend going this route if possible. If
you’re trying to delete an email account, I would recommend deleting all your
emails and flooding the email account with mail bombers to spam the inbox with
random information to help clear out any of your personal data.

Another good resource to spark your memory for rogue accounts is
justdeleteme.xyz, which has a list of different services that may help you
remember. I also like using this as a resource before creating accounts to see
how difficult it is to delete it down the road. If something is too difficult to delete, I
won’t open the account.

Now, I know how difficult it is to entirely delete some accounts. So what if you
aren’t comfortable deleting a service you still want to keep? First, if it’s something
you use consistently, make sure you’re utilizing privacy settings and giving the
least amount of personal information possible. If you aren’t deleting the service
because you have some form of data on there you don’t want deleted, like maybe
a cloud storage service, see if you can move that data and \* hold external HDD \*
store it locally (with proper security) so you can finally delete that account and
still keep your data.

This entire process can be quick for some of you, but a majority will likely have to
spend days, or even weeks working on this since you may have countless services
accumulated over the years. Trust me, it’ll feel good and worth it once you’re
done!

Next up is Google’s ‘My Activity’ page, Go to “Delete Activity By”, select “All Time”
and “All Products”, Then go to ‘activity controls’ and turn everything off to stop
this stop this data collection. If you’re looking to go to the next level, I’d advise
deleting Google altogether! This is very tough to do, but for those of you who
really value privacy, this is a necessary step; I put together a video breaking down
the entire journey. As for alternatives for individual Google services, these will all
be discussed throughout the course, like safe messaging platforms, cloud
storage, emails, etc…

Moving on…If you found anything exposing your real emails, passwords, or any
other information about you in a Google search or ‘have I been pwned’, then
you’ve got a problem. You must immediately change your passwords on these
accounts, immediately! Don’t forget about your other accounts which may use
the same password. Alternatively, you can shut these accounts down altogether,
which is what I’d recommend. As for exposed personal information, this is going
to depend on whether or not you have the ability to remove it. If you do, then
simply remove the identifiable information from the service and wait for Google
to update its search engine. If you can’t change or remove it, then contact the
owner or writer of the page to see what they can do about it.

Exposed pictures are a bit easier to track though! You can find them by dragging
an image into google images to do a reverse image lookup, and find where that
picture is posted on the internet. Another website, which does the exact same
thing with slightly different results is Tineye. If you do find something on a site
you have control of, simply login and remove the image yourself. If you don’t have
control of the website, there are a couple options: 1) Contact the site’s support
team and tell them you don’t give permission to have that image on their website.
They will typically honor this; if they don’t, the second option is to file a DMCA
request by following the instructions in the link found in the course sources. This
should be a last priority though since it dives into legal waters, and it could get
you into trouble if you’re misrepresenting the request.

Let’s discuss your favorite topic: Social media. The obvious goal is to delete it
altogether to dramatically improve your privacy, but I know a lot of you may not
want to take that route. No matter what, avoid using your full name if possible,
make sure your accounts are private, enable as many privacy settings as
possible, and avoid entering any information that isn’t needed. Facebook doesn’t
need to know your address or birthday, so why give it to them? Bonus points if
your public profile picture doesn’t include your full face, so strangers don’t know
what you look like without adding you as a friend. I’d also recommend you go on
a friend/follower purge where you remove everybody you don’t actually know
from your account, to avoid rogue snoops in your life. Once again, I’d advise
removing it altogether, not only is there some severe privacy invasion going on,
but it has been shown to negatively impact your mental health--just something to
think about.

The very last thing you need to take care of is the people-searching websites.
How do you remove your information on these sites? Sadly, you’re going to have
to reach out to all of these companies individually, and request them to remove
your information. It’s very tedious and every site has a different removal process.
ComputerWorld wrote an excellent guide going through people-searching
websites, and how to remove your data on all of the major pages. This other
website also has a guide which lays out the manual process, and they offer a
service you can purchase to do it for you, although I would recommend going
manual.

Okay! At this point, you should hopefully have removed a good chunk of the
services you don’t use anymore, falsified any information for the ones that don’t
need your information, and only kept your actual information on as few services
as possible. This is your clean slate!

Now, there’s no other place to say this in the course, so I’m saying it here. You
don’t need to register for services like Lifelock. \* Throw all of these things over
your shoulder \* You’re wasting your money, time, and giving up information to a
company that doesn’t need to have it. Everything we’ve gone through in this
lesson accomplishes the same thing as Lifelock, and this entire course will teach
you how to protect yourself so you won’t need to worry about identity theft and
other invasions of your privacy. Not to mention...Lifelock is partnered with
Equifax, who suffered one of the largest leaks in American history. Not only did
Equifax suffer from this leak, but they profited from it through services like
Lifelock. URGHH

That’s going to wrap up erasing your online identity. It’s very difficult to cover
everything in one lesson, but that covered JUST about everything. The rest will
come later when we retouch on this subject more in-depth. Hopefully if you
followed a lot of these steps, you’ll get the feeling of digital control, maybe for the
first time in your life! And this is just the beginning! I hope you enjoyed this lesson and thank you for watching.

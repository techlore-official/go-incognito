# Section 2 Introduction

Welcome to Section 2! Things are finally going to \*KICK\* kick off, and it’s time to
learn some new stuff. If you’re going through this course, you’re going to fall into
a few categories: You could be a beginner who is learning about all of this for the
first time. Maybe you understand the basics but need to learn more advanced
techniques, or maybe you are advanced and just trying to make sure you’re
doing the right stuff. Well the best place to start is to look in the mirror, What
does your digital life look like? How is it mapped out and what stains are on your
mirror? This is known as your digital footprint, or your digital identity, digital life,
there are lots of names for this. Essentially it is how much information that is tied
to you on the internet. Some of you have publicly accessible passwords you don’t
know about, and some of you have your entire life downloadable in a profile
online. This would be a very large and extensive digital footprint, which you don’t
want, but unfortunately many of you have.

So what do we do? Sadly, there’s no single website that quantifiably tells you how
good or bad your footprint is, but section 2 will teach you how to personally
evaluate your footprint, as well as how to make it as small as possible. In general,
the younger you are, the easier this is going to be. You’re going to have less
emails, less websites you’ve signed up for, less companies you’ve applied to, but
this isn’t necessarily the case for everybody.

So without further adieu, let’s start section 2 with ‘Minimalism’.

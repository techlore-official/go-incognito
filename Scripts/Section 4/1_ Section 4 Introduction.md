# Section 4 Introduction

Hello, and welcome back to the course. This video will kick off section 4, a
continuation to section 3, titled Advanced Digital Protection...the creativity is real.
If you’ve done section 3, you’ve taken care of a lot of the basics for your general
browsing habits and the way you interact with your devices, so good job there!
But, there is so much more to talk about...this section will cover alternative
operating systems, live operating systems, virtual machines, the much
anticipated Tor, shopping privately and securely online, a word on
cryptocurrencies, and checking up on yourself, aka auditing.

Section 3 involved mostly things you could implement today to change your
security and privacy habits, and it (for the most part) was nothing life changing,
despite the benefits it brought to the table. However, section 4 will cover things
that may dramatically change the way you interact with your devices. That
includes changing your main operating system, installing a custom ROM on your
Android device, using a Live OS that records 0 information about you, shipping
items to different locations, and using painfully slow browsers that may break
some websites. This is why it’s advanced, and it’s important you go into section 4
knowing that.

That’s it for this introduction, I will see you in the next lesson, discussing desktop
operating systems.

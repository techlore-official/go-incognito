# Section 4 Finale

Section 4 has been a ton of fun! Although section 3 was very important in
teaching the basics of what you should be doing every day, it’s a lot more fun for
me to be teaching you about the advanced stuff. At this point in the course, you
should know near everything you need to know about passwords, Tor, VPNs,
proxies, cryptocurrencies, minimalism, erasing local and online identities, secure
communication, two-factor authentication, and file encryption, just to name a few
topics we’ve talked about. There was a LOT MORE!

The only two major sections of the course left are “physical privacy and security”,
and “living the lifestyle”:, both of which are important and need to be taken
seriously if you want the other stuff you’ve learned to be fully worth it. Here’s a
great little comic which demonstrates why…you can implement the absolute best
protection on the software side of your life, but if you can’t physically protect it,
you’re still vulnerable. It has been an absolute pleasure to be with you up until
this point, and I will see you in section 5! Congratulations on making it this far.

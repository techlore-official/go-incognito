# Desktop Operating Systems

Your digital world starts with booting up your computer into its operating system.
Almost everything you do runs on top of an OS like Windows, MacOS, or
Linux--making them extremely important in our quest towards privacy and
security. \* show helmet \* It’s like wearing a super protective helmet on a bike
without breaks.

We’ll dive off our bikes and explore this more after a quick message…

Now technically, operating systems run on top of a BIOS, on top of your
hardware. This will all be discussed in section 5, we’re going from the top and
working down. If you followed everything privacy-related I’ve taught you so far in
this course, it’ll not be fully utilized if you did it on Windows 10, since a lot of what
you’re doing is being tracked by the operating system itself.
So let’s break down different operating systems.

Let’s begin with the most used desktop operating system: Windows, by Microsoft.
Overall, Windows is the option to strike a balance between hardware capability
and application availability, but it falls short in privacy. I am forced to use
Windows to edit this, since Adobe refuses to support other operating systems
that allow me to use my own optimized hardware. Gamers will also find it
challenging to use other operating systems because of poor support. For privacy,
it’s well known that Windows tracks you and functions as spyware. In fact, they
even handed over encrypted messages to the NSA at one point. If you need to
use Windows either for work or entertainment, you can use tools like W10Privacy
to disable some of this tracking and help you out a little bit. Don’t forget to
disable any settings you don’t need, and minimize the information you hand
over--this was all discussed in lesson 3.3.

MacOS is the next major operating system by Apple. Is it more secure than
Windows? The answer isn’t so simple...

Malware is any piece of unauthorized software designed to cause damage to a
system. Malware relies on the use of vulnerabilities and exploits within an
operating system to properly function. \* hold calculator \* To compare Windows
and MacOS, we can look at the number of vulnerabilities and how widely they are
utilized to infect consumers. Luckily, The Hacker News published an article from
2015 that found MacOS does have fewer exploits than Windows, although they
still do exist. So yes, Macs can and DO get viruses. This does not tell a full story
behind what’s more secure, it’s just a basic comparison. Unfortunately, because
of the common misconception that Macs don’t get viruses, people tend not to
use proper browser habits and/or implement an antivirus when needed, which
causes people to unknowingly get their Macs infected.
Privacy is something else Apple claims to take seriously. Now yes, Apple will give
you generally better privacy than Microsoft, but they still aren’t very
privacy-friendly.

Apple claims all personal data is processed on the physical device, not on an
Apple server. In reality, consumer data is “anonymised”, and eventually sent to
Apple’s servers. So Apple does form a portfolio on you and your habits, but it’s
not tied to your personal iCloud account directly. The issue is things can be tied
together extremely easily, especially when Apple has control of your data.
This has proved to be true...Apple has disclosed and given up information on
iCloud users, almost 2,000 times in just the first half of 2015. They helped the FBI
identify the owner of Kickass Torrents. Don’t forget Apple is in the NSA’s PRISM
project, which gives the NSA access to Apple data. So I would say Apple is a more
privacy-oriented company than Microsoft, but it’s important to realize Apple is
not as private as they market themselves to be.
Between Windows and MacOS, MacOS will offer you overall better privacy and
security than Windows.

The third major variant of operating systems is Linux, which runs on the open
source Linux kernel that serves as a platform for many different operating
systems, known as linux distributions, ranging from Ubuntu and all the way to
redstarOS. It’s what many consider to be the king of security and privacy, but
don’t get on that hype train just yet.

Most Linux distros aren’t inherently any more secure than Windows or MacOS,
Security through obscurity will work in your favor at the time of making this
course, since fewer people using Linux makes it a less targeted OS, but that’s not
technically better security. A great thing about most linux distributions is they
are free and open source, so any person is able to view the code, making it easier
to catch exploits in advance.

Privacy on Linux distributions is going to vary on the distribution, but in
general…it is significantly more private than Windows or MacOS. Even the more
popular distros that came under fire for privacy concerns suffered problems that
are minor in comparison to what Apple and Microsoft have done.
For those who are new to Linux, popular options like Ubuntu or Linux Mint make
the switch easy, offering decent security and privacy. For moderate and
advanced users, take a look at Fedora and Debian. Some of you are probably
screaming “What about tails?!” Relax...Tails is a LiveOS, something we’ll be talking
about in the next few lessons.

The last major OS to discuss is BSD, or Berkeley Software Distribution. The two
most common variants are FreeBSD and OpenBSD, and they both will feel similar
to most Linux distributions with some under-the-hood changes and licensing
differences. In general, most of you should probably stick with Linux-based
operating systems, but if you are interested in BSD, there is this great website
breaking it down pretty well, and then you can decide if Linux or BSD is right for
you.

That wraps up desktop operating systems. Each of you will draw your
convenience line at different areas, and it’s fully understandable why switching to
Linux may be difficult, since lots of the software you use may not be fully
compatible with Linux. For those who are on the edge, I have a few words of
wisdom:

First, you can use Linux without installing it. You can create a virtual machine,
which I’ll discuss later in section 4, or you can create a \* show flash drive \*
bootable liveOS, which I’ll also talk about.

Second, there are many FOSS alternatives to the programs you use every day. It’s
just a matter of researching and finding the best option.

Third, you don’t necessarily have to choose between Linux and Windows, you can
have the best of both worlds by dual booting, which lets you use two operating
systems on the same computer. This is common among gamers, since Linux
doesn’t have great gaming support. What gamers do is they download and use
games on Windows, restricting the amount of personal information they share,
and they use Linux for everything else, making sure nothing crosses over. I’d also
recommend checking out Switched to Linux’s channel on YouTube, who has
amazing content talking about Linux and easy ways to switch over, we actually
did a stream together going through some tips for all of you, to make the switch
as easy as possible.

And that’s everything I have to say about desktop operating systems. \* hold
popsicles \* There are many flavors to choose from and the choice is entirely
yours. The next lesson will cover mobile operating systems, so make sure to stick
around for that. Thank you for watching, and see you then!

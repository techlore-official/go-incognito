# Safe Communication

To finish out section 3, we’re going to talk about one of the most important ways
we use the internet: To communicate! You would think the private
communications between you, family, friends, and coworkers would be secure
and private. Well, no. Unfortunately, we communicate on an internet where our
messages are inherently insecure with the illusion that what’s being shared is
kept private. Let’s dive deeper into the topic…

By default, it is extremely difficult to communicate privately and securely digitally.
It’s a weird thing to think about. In our society, we respect people’s personal
space because we want them to respect ours. If you want a conversation to be
kept secret between you and another person, you simply talk in a room where no
one else is listening. So how do you communicate safely over the internet? Glad
you asked…

A disclaimer in advance...most of the methods covered in this lesson rely on not
only you to use a specific service, but the person you’re talking to as well. Another
disclaimer is you’re most likely not going to be able to switch all of your contacts
to a service, but the more you can switch the better.

One of the most prevalent and standardized forms of communication is the text
message, \* hold two phones up \* sent between two phone numbers. The
technology that powers these messages is called SMS, or short message service,
and this is all handled by your cellular provider, like Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint.
Unfortunately, these texts are generally not encrypted, and cellular companies
collect all of our conversations; they’re known to hand it over to intelligence
agencies. As a matter of fact, beginning in 2002, the NSA asked AT&T to build
secret rooms in their facilities: One in Bridgeton, Missouri, and another on
Folsom Street in San Francisco. More were eventually added in Seattle, San Jose,
LA, and San Diego, and these rooms were used to channel all internet, email, and
phone traffic through a filter that would look for keywords. It was recently
discovered this practice continues today. Outside of government surveillance,
are there security issues with SMS messages? Absolutely! There are commercially
available eavesdropping devices that steal SMS messages Because of these
issues, I would recommend you avoid SMS if your goal is privacy and security,
especially when it involves sensitive data. So what do we use?

The first alternative is what many of your devices come with by default, things like
iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, one of Google’s countless
other messengers, Blackberry Messenger, Skype, and so on. I like to classify these
as ‘Triple C’, or common commercial communication methods which will typically,
(not always) offer decent security, with lackluster privacy. Many of these
implement some form of encryption, although it is (for the most part proprietary),
and some don’t use end-to-end encryption like Hangouts. Proprietary encryption
is typically a big no as the company holds a large amount of power that could
eventually lead to unauthorized access to your data. Of all the Triple C services
out there, I would argue iMessage is one of the better ones, but you’re really just
picking between the worst fruit from the tree. Here’s a nice website that compares
the main messengers for you.

So what are the good options? Well looking at that chart: Signal, Threema, Wire,
Telegram, and Wickr seem decent. Each has its pros and cons, so I’d recommend
sorting through this yourself. Be wary of services like Whatsapp whocollect
metadata, a problem we discussed in section 1. Telegram is popular as well,
although often debated in the security realm. They suffered a hack in 2016 that
exposed 15 million phone numbers, and they use proprietary software on the
backend so we can’t verify that. On the upside, Telegram has been banned in
many countries, which is interpreted as good news since it means countries are
struggling to access data in an unauthorized manner. Just like MF DOOM says
“Can’t understand it, ban it.”

No matter what service you end up going with, here are some things to research
when selecting a messenger: Try to choose something with off-the-record
messaging, or OTR--it’s a higher standard of encryption for messages. Also look
for ‘Perfect Forward Secrecy” or PFS, so if one encryption key is compromised, the
others will be safe. Lastly, don’t forget what information is required to open an
account. Signal requires a phone number; you can fake this easily, but this still
concerns people.

I’ve already mentioned some services that hit some, or all of these requirements,
but there are more options. Chatsecure utilizes XMPP, more on that soon.
Crytocat is okay if you’re alright with not having mobile clients.
I mentioned XMPP. XMPP is a protocol used for sending messages with
decentralization, open standards, and security as the main benefits, although
keep in mind by default there is no end-to-end encryption, you must configure it.
You can use Jabber to set it up, Kontalk, or any other XMPP client. There’s also
the Matrix protocol, which attempts to improve on XMPP and is used in services
like Riot.im.

To summarize, at the end of the day, the messenger you pick is your call, each
has pros and cons, and it ultimately comes down to what you trust the most, in
combination with where your priorities lie, and what services you can realistically
get your friends and family to use.
Outside direct messages, what about phone and video calls? For entry level stuff,
Whatsapp offers both of these, and it’ll do an okay job, but remember that
metadata is a huge problem. Signal is better, and offers both phone and video
calls. Wire is also decent. For a more advanced phone threat model, consider
using prepaid or burner phones for sensitive conversations. If you want a more
permanent secondary number: iNumbr, Burner, and Shuffle are all great services
to go check out.

Moving on to email! This seems to be pretty good, right? Well, depending on your
client, email can identify you by the IP address you use to send the message.
Proxies do the trick well here, since the encryption is likely being handled by your
email provider, and all we need is a tool to hide our IP address. To make email
even more private, use something called an anonymous remailer, which changes
the email address of the sender before sending the message, and the recipient
responds to the remailer. This essentially works as a proxy for your email
address. There are 3 types of remailers: type 1 and 2 don’t allow you to respond to
emails, it’s one way only. Type 3 allows responding, forwarding, and encryption.
When it comes to email encryption, try to not let a company like Google handle
the encryption. Not only do they hold the keys, but services like Google scan all of
your emails and use it to build a profile on you. You have a lot of options for
encryption...there’s Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, there’s GPG, or openPGP. They are
typically tricky to setup, but there are services like Mailvelope that simplify things
a lot. ProtonMail, disroot.org Tutanota, and CounterMail also seems good. These
are just random recommendation to look into. Lastly don’t forget about
self-hosting your own email if you can go that route.
Remember though, just because the email is encrypted, doesn’t mean there’s no
metadata stored within the message. Make sure to watch the metadata lesson
from the first section of the course.

If you need temporary disposable email addresses to use online, Tempmail is a
great site as well as Guerrilla mail; keep in mind neither are inherently
anonymous, there are other temporary email alternatives as well.

As for alternative email solutions, I2P-Bote is a fully decentralized email system. It
supports different identities and minimizes metadata exposure, making it a cool
project.

One final overlooked form of communication is file sharing. You can use email,
but you’ll be limited on size and number of files. No matter how you share the file,
make sure you encrypt it before uploading it to the internet, we already covered
how to do this in section 3. As for how to share it, if it’s encrypted it’s not a huge
deal to upload on a service like Dropbox, but I’m still not going to recommend it.
You can use something like Nextcloud. There’s also Firefox Send, which will
encrypt and store a file.. The last service is OnionShare, an open source project
on Tor, which lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size. This is
very promising. No matter what service you choose, encrypt the file before
uploading it, and give the password to your recipient using another
communication method.

So that’s going to cover the different main forms of communication on the
internet. Section 3 has been a ton of fun, time-consuming, but fun. We’re halfway
done with the entire course! I’ll be doing a final little wrap up in the next lesson, so
I’ll see you there, and thank you for watching!

# Section 3 Introduction

Welcome to section 3 of the course! This section is titled ‘Basic Digital Protection’,
and it’s the first part of our Digital Protection series, the following section will be
part 2: ‘Advanced Digital Protection.’

These next 2 sections are aimed at teaching you how to improve the way you use
your devices, so that there is both an improvement in security, and privacy. At
this point, you should have completed section 2 to get yourself a pretty clean
slate and a manageable digital footprint. We have done all of this to protect your
Pi^2, or PII, aka Personally Identifiable Information. The techniques we will discuss
in section 3 will make sure that your digital life stays that way, and it doesn’t once
again become cluttered with your data roaming everywhere without you having
control. We are going to accomplish this by discussing how to stay updated,
setup proper password management, two-factor authentication, browser setup,
browser hardening and habits, browser uniqueness, VPNs, Proxies, malware
protection, secure file deletion, secure storage and encryption, and safe
communication methods. Yes, this is a huge section packed with information so
I’d encourage you to take notes to help you follow along. Premium viewers have
access to the checklist, which will make things easier to manage on your end.

Since every lesson you watch will give you more and more control of your data,
my hope is you’ll begin to feel ownership of it for the first time in your life. That is
all I have to say, thank you for watching the course, and I’ll see you in the next
lesson: ‘Stay Updated.’

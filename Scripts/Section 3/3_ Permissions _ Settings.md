# Permissions & Settings

Permissions! Like giving the permission to access your data is something very
powerful that we typically overlook. We tend not to read the permissions we grant
services, and we unknowingly configure our operating systems to allow ourselves
to be tracked. This is obviously a big problem for several reasons. Let’s cover
some stories and scenarios where permissions led to privacy invasions, and how
we can change that!

Recently, Facebook suffered a pretty big hit after it was revealed that a company
called Cambridge Analytica was stealing private customer data from users who
authorized access to their Facebook account. This was HUGE, millions of people’s
information was stolen and it’s believed to have been used to influence the 2016
US election. On top of that, Facebook tried to push it under the mat until it was
finally made public.

Android typically enables location history, which tracks everything you do and
everywhere you go with extreme accuracy. You can open your Google maps and
view the timeline of your entire life if you haven’t disabled this yet. Apple does the
same thing with their significant locations setting, comboed with Popular near
me, device analytics, and more.

Uber is an app that routinely asks users for permissions, including access to their
location, something that’s necessary to use the app in order to find drivers. Uber
compiles a personal collection of every trip users take, creating a digital
honeypot. A honeypot is a large amount of wanted information in one
easy-to-access place, which can be easily targeted by hackers or other data
collectors. In 2015, Uber changed some of its privacy policies so that they could
collect location data from all US-based users when the app was running in the
background, even if the satellite and cellular communications were turned off. By
using nearby Wifi and IP addresses. This titled ‘god view’ was extremely
dangerous and unneeded, since it collects data about everywhere you go when
the app isn’t even open. Additionally, Uber also got caught for working with Apple
on a secret permission allowing them to copy a user’s screen content.

On the topic of cars...Tesla is an excellent company that makes phenomenal cars.
When you buy a Tesla, you’re given a consent form which gives you the ability to
allow Tesla to record any information about your car over a wireless
communication system. If you accept, Tesla will collect your Vehicle ID, speed
information, odometer readings, battery usage information, battery charging
history, safety-related data, and much more. An entire portfolio of where and how
you drive is created which you have no control over, Tesla owns it and can do
with it whatever they please. You can contact Tesla to opt out of this, but you will
miss out on automatic software updates, as well as other features of the car.

The lesson with all of these stories is the less permissions you grant programs
and apps the better. All it takes is one of these companies to suffer a breach for
your information to be publicly available online. Practice minimalism to avoid
rogue permission abusers, go through all the settings on your devices and deny
any unneeded permissions, and restrict as many features and settings as
possible, especially unneeded ones. You have to remember that by default, most
companies will heavily track you. It’s up to you the user to take back ownership of
your data.

Some good pointers:
- Don’t enable information sharing between apps.
- Disable diagnostics and other information sent to the manufacturer of
your device.
- Find alternatives to apps, programs, and services you use that are FOSS
and non-proprietary.
- Personalization is the enemy, so make sure to disable as many settings and
app permissions that can be used for personalization, because
personalization is a synonym for data collection.
- For Android devices, checkout the Appcensus website, they break down
privacy concerns for lots of apps from the Play Store, so it may be worth
checking this before downloading an app.
- As we’ll discuss later, ditching Windows 10 isn’t a bad idea, it’s a privacy
nightmare, but for many of you--you may still need to use it. You can
optimize windows 10 for privacy and security, using tools like these,
although keep in mind they don’t remove 100% of everything, they just help.
- Avoid syncing accounts that allow friends or family members to access or
share private information. It’s easy to end up in a situation where you have
to explain to your kid what’s that monster hanging between your legs and
why their mother sent a salivating emoji as a response to it. Try to keep
your accounts private, and only accessible by you to avoid any possible
confusion.
- Lastly, make sure you’re the administrator and that any other users or
guests have limited permissions. This is similar to the principle of “least
privilege” in a corporate or security setting. Where employees are granted
the minimum permissions needed to get a job done.

I hope that helped you understand the need for limiting permissions, because
most data breaches and privacy invasions are a result of poor permission
etiquette. It’s important for you to understand what type of data is being
collected about you from the features, settings, apps, and programs you use
everyday. Remember minimalism and transfer the ideas from there to here.
Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next lesson talking about passwords.

## Changes
***- Uber gets picked on A LOT in this lesson, which sparks the question: What about Lyft? They are a
    smaller company, but this doesn’t protect everything from getting out. Lyft has also come under
    some fire, as seen in this article: https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/lyft-god-view/***
    
***- Tesla is mentioned to have a form where you opt-in to cellular communication with the vehicle. Please be aware their process has updated, and opting out MAY involve voiding your vehicle’s
warranty and many other major concerns. The Techlore channel has covered this topic here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjkt3X2WLrw and will be covering this more in the future.***

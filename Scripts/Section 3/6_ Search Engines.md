# Search Engines

Search engines are your gateway to the sites you visit everyday. They act as a
middle man, allowing us to search for what we want and connecting us to what
we’re looking for. But, because of their ability to view everything we do, they have
become some of the world’s largest data collectors, including Google, Microsoft
(through Bing), and Yahoo. These are all very non-privacy oriented companies,
and even if you don’t have an account with them, they are still building a profile
on your searches for commercial purposes. Obviously, this is a big privacy
concern...we can’t have people knowing everything we’re searching for and tying
that to our personal information.
Because of this, we need to find search engines that collect as little information
about us as possible. Luckily there are three very good options which we will
discuss today, each with their own pros and cons.

One of the cons to the free version of this course is the promos, so here we go...

The first service is DuckDuckGo, which is probably the most popular and widely
used privacy search engine. Some of the nice things about DuckDuckGo is they
have a beautiful UI, they are privacy-oriented and extremely public about the
information they collect about you. In addition, they let you use tags to instantly
search different search engines, and they offer an onion variant to be used
inside of Tor. Some problems are they are based in the United States, sparking
jurisdiction concerns, and the core of the service uses proprietary software.
There are additional concerns with DuckDuckGo being a company that relies on
Amazon to deliver their service, since this could be a potential avenue of attack
from intelligence bureaus looking to track DuckDuckGo users Because of privacy
concerns, I wouldn’t say DuckDuckGo is our best bet, although it’s still infinitely
better than Google, Bing, and other mainstream search engines.

The second service out there is StartPage, which works a bit differently from
DuckDuckGo. What StartPage does is they grab Google search results, but they
supply it to you through their own service, stopping Google from seeing the user
behind the search. People typically call StartPage a Google proxy, since all they’re
doing is acting as a private middleman. Because you are getting Google results,
you are going to have the best possible search experience using StartPage. Some
of the downsides are: one, they aren’t very popular, so setting this to work with
your browser by default may prove to be difficult, depending on the device and
browser of your choice. And second, they don’t offer an onion site for Tor users,
so you’ll have to connect to their normal website when you’re using Tor, we’ll talk
about Tor in section 4.

The last service is Searx me, apparently the x can make a ch sound in some
languages, so we’re going to go with that pronunciation. It is commonly regarded
to be the best search engine when it comes to your privacy. They are an open
source metasearch engine, meaning they get results from several search engines
and bring them to you using their service. It privately grabs results like StartPage
does with Google, but it offers a lot more services, as you can see here. It actually
grabs results from DuckDuckGo and Startpage as well, soooo yeah if you can go
this route, I highly recommend Searx. The way they supply results is plain
awesome.

So those are the three big names when we’re talking about privacy-oriented
search engines. It’s important to move your searches off of unprivate search
engines, to services that value your privacy. Once you pick the one you like, I’d
recommend setting it as your default search engine and adding it to your
omnibar search on the top of your browser if possible.

That’s going to wrap this up, it’s a fairly simple topic and I hope it all made sense.
The next four lessons are going to be a quadrilogy about browsers. There’s so
much information about proper browsing habits, so those will teach you
everything you need to know. The first lesson is titled: Your Browser. Until then,
and thank you for watching.

# Welcome! First Words...

Hello future privacy and security advocates, and welcome to Go Incognito, a
course teaching you how to be secure and private in our modern-day world. This
is a pretty big number * 1,946,181,599 * Well, it’s the total number of records
containing personal and other sensitive data that have been compromised
between January 1st, 2017--and March 20, 2018. Pretty crazy stuff that we will learn
how to prevent through the course!


My name is Henry, and I am a privacy and security enthusiast. Since 2014, I’ve
been running a YouTube channel called Techlore, where we have a community
covering topics like VPNs, Tor, encryption, and other security and privacy
tutorials.


My goal with the channel, and especially this course, is to make more and more
people around the world aware and educated in taking control of their privacy
and security. Not only should this information be easy to follow and implement,
but it should be accessible. This course brings both of those things to the table.
So what are we going to cover? Well, just about everything you need to know
about how you’re tracked online, how your information is shared, all the
techniques required to take back your digital privacy, how you can properly
secure all of our data, prevent identity theft and hacks, and lastly, how to get as
close to anonymous as we possibly can. All of this information will help keep you
safe from websites, people you know, strangers, and everyone in between.
Now it’s easy for me to tell you that’s all that’ll be covered and it’s easy to follow
along, but the truth is each of these topics requires a lot of information and a lot
of work on your end. Luckily, I’ve condensed everything you need to know, in the
shortest and most concise manner possible to make it easy for everyone to
follow, no matter your previous experience.


Here’s what you can expect: There are 7 sections, each focusing on a general
topic, and individual lessons within each section narrowing down on specific
things you need to know. Anytime I reference something inside of a lesson, you’re
going to see a number on the screen, which corresponds to the PDF I have on the
course’s page on my website with all of my sources. You should continually check
that webpage because there will also be a changelog, where I will update and
change any information in the future since privacy and security is
always-changing.


This version of the course is the free version, which gives you the same exact
information as the premium version, but there will be advertisements, and you will
be missing out on the quizzes, checklists, certificates, and other perks. You can
find the premium version with all of those benefits on Udemy. You will also be
able to view and download this entire course for free through my website.
Thank you in advance for purchasing the premium version of this course. It’s
been a long journey to make this happen and your support means so much to
me. Throughout the ad-free course, you’ll find quizzes, tests, checklists, scoring
methods, and lots of other perks only available to you. If you want to view the free
version of the course it can be found on the course’s website, my channel, on
several file-hosting services, and its own torrent.


Before wrapping things up, I do want to leave a few disclaimers:  

1. As I mentioned, things change. Projects shut down, technology improves,
and new methods of doing certain tasks are created. The website and my
channel will continually push out changes for any information when
needed. Please contact me if you think something should be added to the
changelog.

2. This course is not created for illegal purposes. This is not what privacy and
security is about, and it’s important that people aren’t breaking the law,
furthering the incorrect association with privacy and security and criminal
activities.

3. Lastly, know that you can build the world’s largest fortress, but at the end
of the day, anyone with enough time and resources can succeed in
breaking into your life. Our goal is to make this as humanly difficult as
possible, or near impossible. No one is truly private, secure and
anonymous, but we can work towards it.


So that’s it for the introduction! It’s an absolute pleasure to have the opportunity
to be here, and I want to welcome you on your new journey. Thank you for tuning
in, I will see you all in the first lesson, going through why you should care. Best of
luck in advance with your new digital lives.

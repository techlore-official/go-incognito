# Why Should You Care?

To kick off the course, I’m sure many of you are already asking, ‘why should I care
about privacy and security’, ‘I have nothing to hide’, and that’s a great question.
First, to quote Miko Hypponen, a computer security expert: “You might not have
anything to hide, but you have everything to protect.” Why is this? What does he
mean? Let’s break it down!

First, not only is privacy from law something in the US constitution, but privacy is
recognized as a fundamental human right in the 1948 United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. The problem is that privacy is ending, it is a crisis.
Your home address, your phone number, your social security number, your bank
accounts, credit history, shopping address, work history, travel habits, and
anything else about your personal information is readily available to anyone who
might be interested in them. The internet has created an environment that makes
it easier than ever for people to harvest your information, and this can impact
you in many ways:

Market Manipulation leads to marketers bombarding your phone and email,
which they purchased from other companies, this can be from your bank, like U.S.
Bancorp in Minnesota, Social media like Facebook which goes through at least
one privacy scandal every year, or even medical records which can be sold, even
though they are meant to be confidential.

\* show wallet \* Credit Card Fraud will cause a headache for days, weeks, or even
months, and the culprit is typically poor privacy and security with your credit
card information. Companies want to convince you there’s no way to protect
yourself, so that they can sell a product to do it for you, I will teach you otherwise.
Identity Theft allows people to commit crimes under your name, which can
permanently affect your life. You don’t need LifeLock to do this for you as we’ll
see later in the course.

Stalking is potentially harmful as well. Not only can this be in the form of
harassment, but it can lead to violence or in rare cases, sometimes death.
Technology has enabled stalkers to track their victims more efficiently and more
accurately than ever before. I would read about Amy Boyer if you haven’t already.
Last but not least, there’s Government Surveillance. The NSA developed Echelon,
a spy network that monitors communication around the world. FinCEN retrieves
personal financial information in real time. Xkeyscore instantly wiretaps
someone’s online conversations by only knowing their email, FASCIA allows them
to track cell phones worldwide, Optic Nerve stole almost 2 million private Yahoo
images, and PRISM allows the NSA to tap into personal private data in tech
companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple. This all surface level, and still crazy
to hear about, there are hundreds of these programs. The government is
increasingly tracking the movements of innocent citizens and doing so as a
matter of policy, not as the result of a warrant and reasonable suspicion. Any opposition to this is greeted by the response that if a person is doing nothing wrong, they should have nothing to hide. We are losing privacy to the
government, and in the process we are falling under its control. Glenn Greenwald
discusses this issue in his TED talk where he expresses concerns behind nonstop
surveillance; I recommend all of you watch this. One of my favorite quotes on the
topic is by Edward Snowden, when he said “Arguing that you don’t care about the
right to privacy because you have nothing to hide, is no different than saying you
don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” Many will argue
that the NSA is keeping us safe. But has the NSA actually kept us more secure? Is
there at least some benefit? Well, the evidence says no.

In 2013 a group analyzed terrorism cases involving the NSA’s bulk collection of
phone records, and found they were completely non essential to preventing
terrorist attacks. In 2014, another report echoed these conclusions, saying that
traditional investigative methods like tips from communities and intelligence
operations have been much more effective than the NSA’s bulk surveillance. The
NSA claimed in 2013 they stopped more than over 50 terrorist attacks, but this list
remains classified which means we have no evidence or proof of its validity. The
NSA did discuss 4 cases in public, and just one where surveillance made a large
impact. This involved a San Diego taxi driver who sent money to a terrorist
organization, but even the details for this case are murky. In 2015, they have
admitted to never stopping any terrorist attacks that might have been large. The
mass telephone records collection program, aka Section 215, was revealed to
have had “no instance in which the NSA could say with confidence that the
outcome of a terror investigation would have been any different” without the
program. We were even told that the NSA sends tips to the FBI about suspicious
phone numbers and email addresses so that the FBI can pursue those leads.
However, I quote “The tips were so frequent and such a waste of time that the
field officers reported back, in frustration, “You’re sending us garbage”.
So I would ask you, the viewer, is tracking every digital communication necessary
to the security of a nation? I would argue there’s not enough evidence to say
there is. Mass surveillance is scary because it can be used as a tool to silence
citizens, similar to the novel 1984, by George Orwell. We’re already starting to see
invasive mass surveillance in countries like China. I know for a fact that you who
is watching this lesson acts differently in your office when there are people
watching you, then when your office is empty. This is the same idea as you being
able to express your true self in society. We can’t live in a true democracy if we
are constantly being surveyed to ensure we are being “proper citizens” in the eyes
of those in power.

In fact, you can already see the silencing of citizens take place today. In the
United States, people who expose fraudulent activities in companies, also known
as \* put on whistle \* whistleblowers, are encouraged and are protected by laws in
many states, in order to hold companies accountable and prevent them from
abusing their power But do we have a similar program like this for governments,
which allows citizens to hold our government accountable? Well, no. If somebody
exposes an NSA document showing our 2016 election included hacks by Russian
intelligence, they would be breaking the law, even though this should be made
public to the people, and the act of making the hack publicly known won’t
endanger our security any more than it already has. Well, this actually happened.
Reality Winner did expose NSA documents showing this to be the case, and
Winner was recently sentenced to prison. Terry Albury was a former
counterterrorism agent at the FBI, who shared classified documents to the media
in an effort to reveal how the bureau treated minority communities unfairly; he
was sentenced up to 10 years in prison. And of course the all-famous Edward
Snowden exposed programs that the NSA was implementing to spy on its citizens
without them being aware. We would still not know these programs exist today if
those documents hadn’t been leaked by Snowden. If you want to learn more
about Snowden and the reasoning behind everything he did, I would recommend
watching the Vice documentary on YouTube, it is phenomenal.

To summarize, you need to protect your data. It \*Hold Key\* holds the key to your
pictures and contacts, the money in your bank, all of your personal information,
and all of your private communication. You’re not going to be sharing your data
with strangers on the street, and just because digital strangers are collecting it
without your knowledge, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t still be a concern. We need to
normalize privacy, and implement better security in our world. I hope I’ve made
my case, and I hope to see more people begin to take their privacy and security
seriously. I will see you in the next lesson on security vs privacy, and don’t forget
to normalize privacy.

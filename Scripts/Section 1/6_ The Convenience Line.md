# The Convenience Line

I mentioned in the first lesson that every individual lesson will cover a specific
topic. These range from passwords, to encryption, pseudonyms, VPNs, Tor, and
more... To give you a heads up: every lesson is broken down more or as less as
follows:

First, there’s a promo, speaking of....

I’ll start with the basics, what you need to know. This will be an introduction to the
topic. Then there’s the big no-nos. Not using the same password for every
website, the easy things that you should be implementing no matter who you are.
Then it will start to get a little bit more advanced. I may tell you to use a password
manager to create more secure and unique passwords for websites. Then, I will
go to the very advanced side of things, where I’m going to recommend not using
cloud-based password managers because you don’t own your keys--things that
are more extreme.

Now you might have noticed the colors were changing behind me. As the lesson
gets more and more advanced, the color will change along with it. Green is the
easy stuff, red is the advanced stuff. Yellow is in the middle. And black is extreme.
Every lesson will be setup this way to better allow you to draw a line; A line
between what? Well I like to call it the convenience line. In general, the more
private and secure you wish to become, the more time and work you’re going to
have to put in, there’s just no way around this.

It’s just like riding a bike. You can have zero security protection for your bike, and
very quickly be able to grab it, hop on, and ride away, very convenient indeed. \*
hold up lock and key \*Now let’s say you put a simple lock on it that requires a key,
well now you have to carry the lock on you everywhere, you have to lock your bike
everytime you stop, and you have to make sure you don’t lose the key.
Convenience has dropped significantly, but your security has gone up. Now let’s
say you get a heavy duty lock, that requires an 8 digit pin, in addition to a key. I
don’t know if they make this, but let’s assume it’s a thing. The convenience has
dropped even more, with a slight bump in security. So yes, there are very
commonly diminishing returns when it comes to security and privacy.

Very similar story to your digital life. You can have all of your files synced across
all of your devices to quickly access everything, you can use no password on your
phones to quickly unlock them, and you can disable encryption to boost speeds
on your phones and computers. At the end of the day, most of us are okay
sacrificing privacy and security for convenience, and we need to turn this
around, it’s become a big problem. Neil Postman, an American author, stated “It is
a mistake to suppose that any technological innovation has a one-sided effect.
Every technology is both a burden and a blessing.” We have lost power over our
lives because we want to enjoy the convenience offered to us. We are open to
dealing with anyone who has a way of bringing us something quickly,
conveniently, and/or cheaply--but in exchange for a little information and
freedom. We will all draw our lines in different areas, and it’s important to
understand your boundaries. Some things in this course will seem extreme to
some, and introductory to others--be aware of your boundaries and how
different people have different lines.

Once again, every lesson will start with the basics, and progressively get less and
less convenient, and this is where you have to draw a line. I am sure that not
everyone watching this course will follow everything I discuss to the max, and that
is totally okay. This course is setup to be used by anybody, no matter who you
are. So I now grant you the ability to \*Hold pencil up\* draw your own line. Thank
you for being here, and see you in the next lesson.

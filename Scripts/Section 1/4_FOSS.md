# FOSS

A term that I’m going to consistently use throughout this course is FOSS, *(Show
Floss)* not FLOSS , FOSS, which stands for Free and open-source software. Rather
than me explaining it every time I use the acronym, let’s cover the term right now.

FOSS isn’t just a category of software--it’s a movement. FOSS is any software that
can be freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change in any you want, while
leaving the source code openly shared so people can voluntarily improve the
software. This is contrary to the idea of proprietary software, where the software
is under restrictive copyright and the source code is hidden from users.
Microsoft, Apple, and most companies use proprietary software on their desktop
operating systems, and most other pieces of software they release.

So what are the benefits to FOSS, well there are plenty:

FOSS is fantastic for privacy and security, which is obviously going to be great
for you taking this course. Manufacturers of proprietary, closed-source software
are sometimes pressured into building backdoors (which gives them or anyone
else access to private data) or other undesired features into their software.
Instead of having to trust software vendors, people that use FOSS can inspect
and verify the source code themselves and can put trust in a community of
volunteers and users.

Now you might be asking, if it’s public, won’t it be easier for hackers to exploit it?
This is far from the truth, since the code is public, more and more people are able
to collaborate to fix any possible exploits to make the software as secure as
possible. This has proved to be very accurate when looking at statistics between
FOSS and proprietary software.

FOSS also gives you greater personal control, customizability, and freedom. If
someone wants to change the functionality of a particular software they can
bring about changes to the code and, if they wish, distribute the modified version
of the software on their own. You gain much more control over your usage and
data as well, since software vendors like Apple, Google, and Microsoft want to
lock you into their ecosystem, which works only the way they intend it to work.
Meaning, you can’t disable those pesky automatic update notifications on your
iPhone, you can’t easily remove Google services on an Android device, and
Microsoft bugs you all day to sign in to your Microsoft account on Windows 10.
These are just a few of the thousands of things companies force you to deal with
everyday. The last benefit is the most obvious one, it’s all free and accessible, you
never have to pay a *(show dime)* dime, since it’s voluntarily run by the
community, and typically relies on donations from users.

Because of all these benefits, I’m going to be recommending FOSS as much as I
can throughout the course. We need to have trust in our software to improve our
privacy and security, and I will typically recommend the software that has
thousands of public eyes looking over it, over the software that is controlled by a
company with 20 eyes looking for their next paycheck. If you want more
information on FOSS, I made a more in-depth video discussing it on my YouTube
channel.

I hope this explained what FOSS is, and why it’s important for this course. If you
want to get a head start, you can start looking for FOSS alternatives to the
software you use everyday by going to alternativeto.net, searching for your
software that you want to change from, and filtering by open source. Thank you
for watching, and I’ll see you in the next lesson covering metadata.

## Changes
***Something I regret not mentioning about FOSS relates to the code and control
    companies/governments have over proprietary software. Just as mountains are natural
    architectural limitations found in nature, software and code have architectural limitations on what
    a user can/can’t do. With proprietary software, the user doesn’t know what these limitations are,
    but FOSS allows the community to understand what the software can and can’t do. Sure, Tesla’s
    have semi-automatic driving utilizing cameras around the car, but how do we know those cameras
    aren’t constantly collecting identifiable information about other cars around us? It is unlikely, but
    there’s no way to disprove the claim. With FOSS, we can disprove it. With FOSS, we know we aren’t
    being limited. With FOSS, we can’t be oppressed unknowingly.***

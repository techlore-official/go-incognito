# Go Incongito Premium Production Improvements

## Overall Changes
- Equalized audio across all lessons
- Added in the most up-to-date information to reflect changes in 2021
- Renovated all earlier sections to better match later sections
- Go Incognito has never felt more seamless between videos, with outros removed, no ads, & transitions to keep everything moving
- Hundreds of other changes, refer to the changes in every lesson below (No lesson went unchanged!) - this also means the course is significantly shorter for viewers - about 30 minutes shorter.

### 1.1
- Removed lip-smacks throughout the lesson
- Removed a few unnecessary sections (mostly rambling)

- Fun Fix: The A-Roll is actually 2 separate video clips, and the original Go Incognito forgot to apply the color correction profile to the second clip the last ~20 seconds of the lesson, which is why it looks so different. Premium applies the proper color correction on the second and final clip.
